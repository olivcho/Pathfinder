# Pathfinder

**Pathfinder** is a custom GPT chatbot specifically designed to help Nueva students comply with BRT project proposal standards. Juniors who are new to BRT should use Pathfinder to **brainstorm research questions**, **discovery new assays and methodologies**, and **assist in the project proposal writing process**.

**Pathfinder** also includes example project proposals from previous years.
